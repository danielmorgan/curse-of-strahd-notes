## RIP: Hekktor

During the attack with the Tree Blight Barry and Hekktor were mortally wounded. Lord Eric had decided to keep range on the tree, since he was already badly wounded by it, and justifying it knowing he was the only one who could Spare the Dying and as such, needed to sruvive more than anyone else. Near the end Bendeith also fell, knocked unconcious and bleeding to death. Lord Eric had pulled too far back and could not reach Hekktor before the Tree Blight ate him. The Delmorian veterans finished off the Tree Blight.

Lord Eric feels incredibly guilty about how his over-caution led to the death of Hekktor, but finds some solace in the fact that he was able to save his friends Barry and Bendeith.

## The Wizards of Wine

* Davian suggests we pay tribute to Hekktor by naming a wine after him
    * Hekktor's Fireball Wine - in honour of the fact he never got to cast Fireball
